# DogBreedClassifierApp

# Disaster Response Pipeline

##  Overview


A machine learning application pipeline that is capable of curating the text messages and classify them. This application has a flask based web UI to assist emergency worker to classify caller's input into several categories so they can route them to its relevant specialized organization. The training data is provided by Figure Eight.


**Dependencies**

- Interpreter: Python 3.6+
- Web : flask, plotly
- Processing : numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, pickle, re
- DB : SQLalchemy


**File Descriptions**

 **data:**
- disaster_categories.csv: File containing message categories
- disaster_messages.csv: File containing the disaster messages
- etl_pipeline.py: ETL pipeline to process messages and categories into a SQLite database
- DisasterResponse.db: SQLite database that contains both messages and categories

 **model:**
- train_classifier.py: ML pipeline to build, train, evaluate, and save a classifer
- classifier.pkl: Pick file of trained model

 **app:**
- run.py: Runs the Flask web app
- templates: HTML files for web app


**Usage**

Clone the repo using:
> git clone https://github.com/RayalaNK/DisasterResponsePipeline.git


Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
> python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db

ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves the model
> python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl

Run the following command to run your web app after navigating into the app directory.
> cd app

> python run.py
