# DogBreedClassifierApp

##  Overview


The objective of this application is to primarily predict whether a given image is of a dog or of a human using Convolutional Neural Networks. If it's either of them, the application will need to further determine the kind of breed the dog is, or which dog breed the human most resembles. When the given image is neither a dog nor a human, predicting the breed wouldn't execute!


**File Descriptions**

**folder/files:**
- dog_app.ipynb: python notebook file with fully functional code, all code cells executable
- web_app/dog_app.html: 
- haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt: Haar feature-based cascade classifiers for face detection
- images folder: Images for the notebook and to test the algorithm are found here
- data/dog_names.csv: Contains names of the dog 

 **models:**
- saved_models folder: contains the best model weights saved of pre-trained models. These weights can be generated by training the models weights.best.VGG19.hdf5, weights.best.VGG16.hdf5 and weights.best.from_scratch.hdf5 

 **app:**
- run.py: Runs the Flask web app
- templates: HTML files for web app

**Usage**

Clone the repo using:
> git clone https://github.com/RayalaNK/DisasterResponsePipeline.git

Run the following command to run your web app after navigating into the app directory.
> cd web_app

> python app.py
